# The Gardens of Democracy
A website that will provide a platform for democracy to flourish. In this website, everyone can join and put there candidacy forward for public office at state and national level. I hope this platform will be used to put forwards ideas and get peoples opinion on these ideas. This platform will be managed by volunteers who will take a oath to never show there political affinity and to be non-bias. 

The moderators will be volunteers:
	Lawyers - to check the validity of the clams and proposals being perused, 
	Accounts - to keep the politicians honest about their financial proposals and ideas
Political officers - who will dig into the back ground of the would-be leaders to make sure that no shady characters end up in the seat of power.
Tech - To make sure the platform is secure and free from influence. Also, the stability of the platform.
	Developers - To build this website and publish it in AWS.
